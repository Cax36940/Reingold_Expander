# Reingold_Expander

This Python project implements the algorithms described in "Undirected Connectivity in Log-Space" by Omer Reingold, 2008. It also includes complementary functions to test the correctness of some parts of the algorithms.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: 

    git clone https://github.com/Cax36940/Reingold_Expander.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

    pip install matplotlib numpy networkx

## Usage

1. Run the test_xxx.py scripts to test the algorithms and functionalities. Some tests are commented out because they can take some time for the entire execution.

2. Modify the code as needed to experiment with different values
